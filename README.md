# zabda-engine
Sanskrit is a very inflectional language and most words have dhatu (from a list of over 1000 words) or noun roots. The longer term goal of this library is to be able to identify words and provide a quick anlaysis or vigraha. The analysis will assist in understanding a word, its root (dhatu) or noun, and the "pratyaya" that are used to give it its form.
